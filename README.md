**The Scroll Calculator**


Screen time reports let us know how much time we spend online (on our phones). But what does your screen time look like quantified and visualized in a different way?

This extension tracks your scrolling when you click the 'Track my scroll' button at the bottom of the page, and then shows you how far you've scrolled after 5 minutes.

To use this extension:

- Download the ZIP file for this repository.
- Go to chrome://extensions, the extension management page.
- Click the toggle switch in the upper right to enable Developer Mode.
- Click the "Load Unpacked" button.
- Select the folder containing this extension.
