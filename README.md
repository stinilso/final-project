***The Scroll Calculator***


Screen time reports let us know how much time we spend online (on our phones). But what does your screen time look like quantified and visualized in a different way?

This extension tracks your scrolling when you click the 'Track my scroll' button at the bottom of the page, and then shows you how far you've scrolled after 5 minutes.


To use this extension:

- Click on the green "Code" button near the top of this page and download the ZIP file for this repository.
- Unzip the file.
- Go to chrome://extensions, the chrome extension manager page (you can also get there by clicking the puzzle piece icon in the upper right corner of the browser and then clicking "Manage Extensions").
- Click the toggle switch in the upper right to enable Developer Mode.

- Select the entire unzipped folder containing this extension.
- Click the puzzle piece icon in the upper right corner of the browser, and pin *The Scroll Calculator* to the extensions bar. The icon for this extension should now be visible, and directions will appear when clicked.
